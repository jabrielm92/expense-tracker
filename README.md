# Check out my expense tracker app

This project was built using React.

A freelance project I'm building for a credit repair/finance company named The MINT Company LLC. App built using React. Login/signup, income input, and expense input all stored in Firebase. User has ability to add/remove both income and expenses. They can also set due dates and reminders. User input is displayed as a dashboard item/card as well as a pie chart. Many other features planned to be implemented, with company electing to have a standard free version and a paid premium version. Take it for a spin!
